# RAMPER
Robust Analysis of Metabolic Pathways under Enzymatic Regulation (RAMPER) is a constraint-based approach to model cell metabolism which
inherently acknowledges stochasticity in modeling parameters.

Code is part of Christoffer Gretarsson Alexandersen's master thesis (May, 2019).

The primary functions createUncModel() and solveUncModel() are found in /Funcs alongside the module uncUtils.py.
All other scripts and functions as described in the thesis are found in /Expr.
